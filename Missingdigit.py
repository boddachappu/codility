""""
An array A consisting of N different integers is given. The array contains integers in the range [1..(N + 1)],
which means that exactly one element is missing.

Your goal is to find that missing element.

Write a function:

def solution(A)

that, given an array A, returns the value of the missing element.

For example, given array A such that:

  A[0] = 2
  A[1] = 3
  A[2] = 1
  A[3] = 5
the function should return 4, as it is the missing element."""


def solution(A):
    B = set(range(1, len(A) + 2))
    A = set(A)
    l = list(B - A)
    return l[0]


print(solution([]))
